## Tutorial at EACL 2017

[Dan Roth](http://l2r.cs.illinois.edu) and [Vivek Srikumar](http://svivek.com)

### 1.Introduction

[30 min]

We will begin by introducing structured prediction with various NLP
examples. We will motivate the framework of Constrained Conditional
Models using examples from sequential inference, sentence compression
and semantic role labeling.


### 2. Applications of ILP Formulations in Natural Language Processing 

[30 min]

Examples will be used to explain several of the key properties the
framework offers. In particular, we will discuss several ways in which
expressive constraints can be introduced into an application.

We will go over the following examples in this section:

- Co-reference resolution
- Sentence compression
- Information extraction

### 3. Modeling: Inference methods and Constraints 

[30 min]

- Modeling problems as structured prediction problems
- The use of hard and soft constraints to represent prior knowledge.
   - Augmenting Probabilistic Models with declarative constraints
- Inference Algorithms


### 4. Training Paradigms 

[30 min]

- Structured learning
- Decomposed learning

### 5. Constraints Driven Learning 

[30 min]

- Semi-supervised Learning with Constraints
- Constrained Expectation Maximization
- Learning with Indirect Supervision


### 6. Developing ILP based Applications 
[15 min]

- A “template-based” approach” for developing applications with ILP formulations
- Software packages and tools 

### 7. Looking ahead 
[15 min]

Structured Formulations in the NN era
